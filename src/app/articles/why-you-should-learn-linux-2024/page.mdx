Have you ever wondered what powers the digital world we live in? Spoiler alert: it’s Linux. And as we move into another year of massive tech layoffs, I would argue, that the reasons to learn Linux are more compelling than ever. Let’s dive into why learning Linux should be on your goals list for this year.

## The world runs on Linux

First things first, Linux is everywhere. It's the silent force behind the majority of the servers powering the internet, from the websites you browse daily to the cloud services you rely on. It's not an exaggeration to say that Linux is the digital bedrock of our modern world. Every time you stream a movie, shop online, or scroll through social media, there's a high chance you're interacting with a service running on Linux.

Every device running Android, which controls over 70% of the global smartphone market, is based on Linux. Even iOS is based on the Mach kernel and FreeBSD, a Unix-like operating system - the precursor to modern-day Linux.

## The backbone of organizations

All organizations, big or small, require servers to power their digital infrastructure. Whether these be cloud-based or on-prem (a dying breed), Linux is often their operating system of choice. Why? Because it's realiable, secure, and highly customizable.

Understanding Linux unlocks a whole new world for you, and will give you a far greater view of the overall software development lifecycle. Especially in smaller organizations, where versatility is key, a developer with knowledge of the Linux ecosystem is invaluable.

## Career advantages of learning Linux

Now, let's talk career prospects - what you've all been waiting for. Linux skills are like gold in the job market, and in some cases can get your foot in the door that would otherwise be slammed on you. From system administrators to cloud engineers to AI researchers, the demand for Linux proficiency is sky-high.

I've chatted with several technical founders and engineering managers who all echo the same sentiment: an understanding of the Linux ecosystem is necessary to become a well-rounded developer. Linux can open doors to some of the most lucrative and exciting career paths in tech.

## The command line: Your new superpower

If you've ever felt like a wizard when using the command line, then you're not alone. Mastering the command line is like unlocking a superpower. It offers a level of control and efficiency tat you just can't get with a graphical interface. And guess what? Linux offers the most powerful command-line experiences out there.

The best part is, you carry it with you wherever you go. Remoting into a server? You'll probably be met with a familiar bash prompt. AWS cloud shell? Bash. Even your MacOS terminal - well ok that's ZSH now but you get the point. The list goes on and on.

## How to start learning Linux in 2024

So, how do you jump into Linux? It's easier than you think. There's a plethora of online resources, courses, and communities ready to welcome new learners. But the best thing you can do is jump right into it. Start with a user-friendly distro like Ubuntu, and gradually build your skills. And remember, the Linux community is incredibly supportive - you'll never be alone in your learning journey.

## Overcoming challenges in learning Linux

It's true, Linux can seem a bit intimidating at first. But don't let that deter you. Many before you have started from scratch, myself among them, and found their footing. With a bit of persistence and curiosity, you'll find that Linux is much more accessible than it appears.

So, why make 2024 the year you dive into Linux? Because the future is open-source, and Linux is leading the charge. Whether you're looking to learn new skills for your career, deepen your tech knowledge, or just enjoy the thrill of mastering something new, Linux is your gateway.

As we step further into the digital age and programmers become more and more abstracted, understanding the systems that underpin our devices is not just an asset - it's a necessity. And who knows? You might just find yourself enjoying it.

Are you ready to embrace the power of Linux? Let's make 2024 the year you do just that!
