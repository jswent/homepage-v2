The tech job market is insane right now, and understandably so. With the echoes of 2023’s record layoffs still resounding and the [forecast for 2024 looking equally tumultuous](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/technology/layoffs-tech-industry.html), the stakes are higher than ever. For those just stepping into the industry, it can feel like an uphill battle.

Navigating the hiring process today often seems like delving into a black box. Most companies guard their processes like secret recipes, with each one employing its own enigmatic screening software. It's like trying to hit a moving target with a blindfold on.

That's why, in the spirit of transparency, I wanted to pull the curtain back on how we conduct our hiring process at Swent Consulting.

## The application

As you can expect, it all starts with an online submission: a resume, a cover letter, and a little bit about yourself. Simple enough, right?

## The initial screening

This is where we take our first glance. We're not just looking at degrees or fancy titles. We're interested in your experience with the technology we need, evidence of independent study and continuous growth, location, and other specific requirements relevant to the position. I make it a point to ensure that everyone's application gets read at least once.

## The screening assignment

Here's the problem: the current SWE market is flooded with applicants shotgunning resumes into every job posting they can find. Our solution? A straightforward assignment to gauge genuine interest, that anyone applying for the position should be able to do in their sleep. If a candidate can't be bothered with this, it's a no-go.

## The first interview

We dive into your assignment and resume, making sure you didn't just chuck the spec into ChatGPT and throw it in a git repo. We'll ask you some questions about your stated proficiencies in specific languages/toolsets. These are all pretty remedial - it's just a litmus test to see if your resume matches reality. You'd be surprised how many do not.

## (Optional) The technical interview

Sometimes, we bring out the big guns: a technical interview. But hold your horses – it's not about grinding through endless LeetCode problems. We tailor these questions to the specific role, focusing on practical skills.

## The culture interview

Our team gets in on the action, too. After all, software development isn't a solo sport. We prioritize a candidate's fit with the team's dynamic, ensuring everyone's on board and excited to collaborate.

## The assessment period

Think of it as a test drive. For 6-8, you work with us on a probationary basis. It's a two way street; either party can part ways afterward with no hard feelings.

## Why the right hire matters

The cost of hiring the wrong person can be steep, and the old adage 'hire fast, fire fast' is far from our mantra. We look for a mutual fit, someone who's not just technically proficient but also gels with our team ethos.

It's important to remember that (most) interviewers are not out to get you. We understand the challenges and frustrations that come with job hunting, especially in such a competitive market. We really do want to help you as much as we can.

Are you intrigued by our approach and interested in joining the Swent Consulting team? We're always looking for passionate and skilled individuals who are ready to make an impact. If you think you've got what it takes, let's start a conversation. After all, it's not just about filling a role. It's about aligning our objectives with your future career goals, and creating value for us all.
